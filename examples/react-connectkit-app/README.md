# Particle Connect

Particle Connect acts as a simple method of aggregating connection with both Web2 accounts through Particle Auth and Web3 accounts through traditional wallets, creating an equally accessible experience for both Web3 natives and traditional consumers. Specifically, Particle Connect is a custom connection modal built around interaction with Particle.
